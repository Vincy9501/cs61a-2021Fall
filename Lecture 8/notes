Q: What is 'Recursive Functions'?
A: A function that the body of the function calls the function itself.

Q: What is the structure of 'Recursive Functions'?
A: There is a common pattern that the body begins with a base case, 
    a conditional statement that defines the behavior of the function.
   A base case will be followed by one or more recursive calls.

Q: What is 'Mutual Recursion'?
A: Two functions call each other and execute a recursive procedure.
